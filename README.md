# Getting Started with Never Bored app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
Make sure you have npm or yarn installed.

### Axios
This project is based on the API http://www.boredapi.com/ , to fetch this we are using Axios. You need to install the following:
#### `npm install axios`

### uuid
To be able to give everything an unique key or id the project is using uuidv4. Install the following:
#### `npm install uuidv4`

### @material-ui
This project includes an API for the rating and the icons. For this you need to install the following:

#### `npm install @material-ui/core`

#### `npm install @material-ui/lab`

#### `npm install @material-ui/icons`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Why react?
This project is based on the front-end Javascript library; React. This is one of the biggest libraries on the market, and allows creators to build quality user interfaces. 

### Educational
The project members already had a ground knowledge of React, and wanted to explore the React community and further develope their knowledges. While on the labor market, React is a very attractive skill-set to acquire, and might land you the tech job of your dreams. 

### Easy to learn
Beacause React is a well known and established library there is a good amount of helpful information, for when developing a new website or application. The React community is big, and if you have a problem it is likely that someone else had the same problem - and fixed it!

### Developer-friendly
Even for beginner developers React has been easy to learn, and much has been self explanatory. React makes it easy for developers to implement other developers published code, including API such as Material UI.
